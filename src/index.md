# Hey.
I'm Aryan, a programmer, music enthusiast and an
inquisitive human. I love building things â€” games, applications, libraries, or
tools that change the way things work. I specialize in C++, with which I'm
currently developing a game engine, [Ducktape](https://github.com/DucktapeEngine/Ducktape), 
using OpenGL.
