		<h1>Hey.</h1>
		<p>
			So, there goes my website's renovation. Actually, this is NOT the first time I'm doing this. I always end up not liking my website design at all - leading to me remaking it from scratch. If I recall correctly, this is ... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5! This is the 5th renovation. It surely has gone a long way. And I'm sure that at some point, I'm going to find this boring as well.
			<br><br>
			That aside, honestly, I've never written a blog. Thus I have no idea what goes here. Am I like supposed to write about something informative? Or inspirational? I mean I'm still in my teens so it's not like I have anything special to talk about I guess. So, I'll start by introducing myself.

			I'm Aryan, a beginner graphics programmer. I specialize in C++, though I am experienced in other languages that are Python, JavaScript, and C#. I'm currently working on a open source 3d game engine with Vulkan — <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DucktapeEngine/Ducktape">Ducktape</a>. That is a rewrite actually. The original Ducktape was complete with 2D Rendering, Physics, Audio, Scripting etc. while making use of SFML. But I figured that using such a high level library won't teach me anything about graphics programming, and also that my code structure was fit to be a library rather than an engine, so I figured it was a good decision to rewrite. <s>But I wouldn't be so sure about Vulkan being a good choice, which took me 1500 lines to render a single triangle</s> Did I mention, that my dream is to get a job at Unreal Engine? Yep and that happens to be exactly why I chose Vulkan and C++.

			I'm thinking that I should blog how my week went every sunday like a diary — sounds like a good idea. Even though it is sunday as of the time of writing, I'm too mentally tired to recall what happened this week, so I'll finish this post here now.
			<br><br>
			Cheers.
